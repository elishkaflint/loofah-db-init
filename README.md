# LOOFAH DB INIT

Script to seed the loofah database.

An init docker container will add the json files in /data into the db.

These data files are provided by the runLoofah.sh script in loofah-tooling, a more detailed 
explanation of how that works is provided in the readme of loofah-tooling.

### To seed the db:

Go to loofah-tooling and run `./runLoofah.sh`
